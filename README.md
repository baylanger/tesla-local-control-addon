# Tesla Local Control add-on

This Addon is a package of iainbullock's [tesla_ble_mqtt_docker](https://github.com/iainbullock/tesla_ble_mqtt_docker)
It runs the official Tesla Vehicle SDK commands via BLE to activate various entities in your Tesla.
This is to bypass the current Fleet API rate limitation and does not rely on the API.

This package contains:
- All the code generated by iainbullock repackaged as a HA addon
- A `standalone` folder which contains a single script to run the BLE service on a separate machine

Notes to developers after forking or using the github template feature:
- While developing comment out the 'image' key from 'example/config.yaml' to make the supervisor build the addon
  - Remember to put this back when pushing up your changes.
- When you merge to the 'main' branch of your repository a new build will be triggered.
  - Make sure you adjust the 'version' key in 'example/config.yaml' when you do that.
  - Make sure you update 'example/CHANGELOG.md' when you do that.
  - The first time this runs you might need to adjust the image configuration on github container registry to make it public
  - You may also need to adjust the github Actions configuration (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow > Read & Write)
- Adjust the 'image' key in 'example/config.yaml' so it points to your username instead of 'home-assistant'.
  - This is where the build images will be published to.
- Rename the example directory.
  - The 'slug' key in 'example/config.yaml' should match the directory name.
- Adjust all keys/url's that points to 'home-assistant' to now point to your user/fork.
